My main concern: The topic of virtual (nonlinear) nonholonomic
constraints has its roots in the works of Grizzle and Griffin in CDC
2015. Since then that notion was used and employed in a very
interesting context as the one in the present paper. Nevertheless, a
mathematical foundation of the subject as happens with virtual
holonomic constraints (done by the second author of the paper under
review) was not provided yet. Some effort has been done recently to
formulate virtual nonholonomic constraints from a geometric framework
in the linear (https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01299) and affine cases
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03890) that I guess they merit to be
mentioned in the literature review of the paper.

My recommendation is based on the next aspects of the paper:

(1)The paper is mathematically correct and self-contained.

(2)The paper is accessible to a wide range of researchers in control
and robotics

(3)The paper demonstrates the theory with real-life experimental.

(4) The experiments are understandable for a wide range of researchers
in control and robotics

(5) The paper is original and the topic is on current research.

I recommend acceptance of the manuscript.
