We have received only two reviews for this paper, which are - however -
sufficiently informative for a recommendation  to be  issued. Overall,
the reviewers praise the high quality of the paper, but request that a
sharper focus is placed on its contribution with respect not only on
the literature on virtual nonholonomic constraints, but the  landscape
of energy-based nonlinear control. While this may appear a daunting
task, the authors are invited to put their work into perspective as
suggested by reviewer no.2.  The remaining issues appear to be well
within the authors' reach.
