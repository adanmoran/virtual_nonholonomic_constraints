%---------- Preliminary Pages -----------%
\begin{preliminary}

% Generate the title page
\include{title}

%% There should be NOTHING between the title page and abstract.
%% However, if your document is two-sided and you want the abstract
%% _not_ to appear on the back of the title page, then uncomment the
%% following line.
\cleardoublepage

% Generate the abstract page, with line spacing adjusted according to SGS
% guidelines
\include{abstract}

%% Anything placed between the abstract and table of contents will
%% appear on a separate page since the abstract ends with \newpage and
%% the table of contents starts with \clearpage.  Use \cleardoublepage
%% for anything that you want to appear on a right-hand page.

%% This generates the 'dedication' page, which will appear on a right-hand page
\cleardoublepage
\include{dedication}

%% The `dedication' and `acknowledgements' sections do not create new
%% pages so we need to separate them
\newpage  % separate pages for dedication and acknowledgements

%% This generates the "acknowledgements" section
%% Note: Comment this out until after you've defended
\include{acknowledgements}

%% This generates the Table of Contents (on a separate page).
\tableofcontents

%% This generates the List of Tables (on a separate page), if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
\listoftables

%% This generates the List of Figures (on a separate page), if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
\listoffigures

%% You can add commands here to generate any other material that belongs
%% in the head matter (for example, List of Plates, Index of Symbols, or
%% List of Appendices).

% Index of Symbols and Notation
\include{symbols}

%% End of the preliminary sections: reset page style and numbering.
\end{preliminary}

%---------- Main Content ----------%
% When using external files, we use \input instead of \include because \input
% allows you to nest the inclusion. This way, we can separate the .tikz files
% for our images and still input them into the code.

% Introduce the thesis
\input{introduction}

% Develop the formulation of VNHCs
\input{vnhcs}

% Discuss the variable length pendulum and prove our VNHC gains energy
\input{vlp}

% Give the Acrobot model, its VNHC, and prove it gains energy
\input{acrobot}

% Concluding remarks and future work
\input{conclusion}

% This adds a line for the Bibliography in the Table of Contents.
