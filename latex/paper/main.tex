\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

In gymnastics terminology, a ``giant" is the motion a gymnast performs to
achieve full rotations around a horizontal bar \cite{usagym_giant}. 
A gymnast will begin by hanging at rest, then swing their legs
appropriately to gain energy over time.
The authors of \cite{pendulum_length_giant_gymnastics} modelled the gymnast as a
variable length pendulum, and studied how the pendulum's length changes as a
function of the gymnast's limb angle.
Labeling the pendulum length by \(r\) and the gymnast's body orientation
by \(\theta\), they observed experimentally that the value \(\dot{r}/r\) has
the biggest impact on the magnitude of energy injection. 
After testing several gymnasts under a variety of experimental conditions, 
they discovered that the peak value of \(\dot{r}/r\) occured at the same fixed
value of \(\dot{\theta}/\theta\) for all gymnasts.
In other words, gymnasts appear to move their legs as a function of their body
angle and velocity when performing giants; 
doing so allows them to gain energy and rotate around the bar.

While the simplest model of a gymnast is the variable-length pendulum, a
more realistic model is the two-link acrobot (Figure \ref{fig:acrobot}).
Here, the top link represents the torso, while the bottom link represents
the legs. 
The acrobot is actuated exclusively at the center joint (the hips).
Controlling the acrobot is a nontrivial task because it is not feedback
linearizable \cite{nonlinear_controllers_nonintegrable_acrobot}. 
To solve the swingup problem, one might begin by designing a leg controller
which provably injects energy into the acrobot, so that the resulting motion
mimics that of a human performing a giant.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{acrobot_gymnast.png}
    \caption{The two-link acrobot as a model for a gymnast.
    Image modified from \cite{xingbo_thesis}.}
    \label{fig:acrobot}
\end{figure}

Previous attempts at acrobot giant generation have involved
trajectory tracking, partial feedback linearization, or other energy-based
methods
( see
\cite{energy_pumping_robotic_swinging,swingup_giant_acrobot,dynamical_servo_acrobot_vc,control_giant_two_link_gymnastic_robot}
).
While all these approaches succeed at making the acrobot rotate around the
bar, none of them use the results of \cite{pendulum_length_giant_gymnastics}.
That is, none of these leg controllers track a function of the acrobot's body
angle and velocity.
In 2016, Wang attempted to design such a controller \cite{xingbo_thesis}
but was unable to prove the acrobot would gain energy over time.
His approach was a rudimentary version of a recent technique know as the method
of virtual nonholonomic constraints.

Virtual nonholonomic constraints (VNHCs) have been used for human-robot interaction
\cite{vnhc_human_robot_cooperation,psd_based_vnhc_redundant_manipulator,haptic_vnhc},
error-reduction on time-delayed systems \cite{vnhc_time_delay_teleop},
and they have shown marked improvements to the field of bipedal locomotion 
\cite{nhvc_dynamic_walking,
hybrid_zero_dynamics_bipedal_nhvcs,output_nhvc_bipedal_control}.
Indeed, they produce more robust walking motion in biped robots than
other controllers which do not depend on velocity \cite{nhvc_incline_walking}.
In particular, VNHCs may be capable of injecting and
dissipating energy from a system in a robust manner, all while producing
realistic biological motion. 

In this article, we will design a virtual nonholonomic constraint which provably
injects energy into the acrobot through human-like giant motion.

\subsection{Notation}
We use the following notation and terminology in this article.
A matrix \(A \in \R^{n \times m}\) is \textit{right semi-orthogonal} if
\(A A\tpose = \Id{n}\) and is \textit{left semi-orthogonal} if 
\(A\tpose A = \Id{m}\).
For \(A \in \R^{n\times m}\) and \(B \in \R^{p \times m}\),
we define \([A;B] \in \R^{(n+p)\times m}\) as the matrix obtained by stacking \(A\)
on top of \(B\). 
For \(T > 0\), the set of real numbers modulo \(T\) is denoted \(\Rt{T}\), with
\(\Rt{\infty} := \R\).
The gradient of a matrix-valued function 
\(A : \R^m \rightarrow \R^{n\times n}\) is the block matrix of stacked partial
derivatives, 
\(\nabla_xA := [\pdiff{A}{x_1};\ldots;\pdiff{A}{x_m}] \in \R^{nm \times n}\).
Given two matrices \(A \in \R^{n \times m}\) and \(B \in \R^{r \times s}\), the
Kronecker product \(A \otimes B \in \R^{nr \times ms}\) (see \cite{kronprod}) is
the matrix
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:kronprod}
    A \otimes B = \begin{bmatrix}
        A_{1,1}B & \cdots & A_{1,m} B \\
        \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        A_{n,1} B & \cdots & A_{n,m} B
    \end{bmatrix} 
    .
\end{equation}
The Poisson bracket \cite{landau_mechanics} between the functions
\(f(q,p)\) and \(g(q,p)\) is
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:poisson-bracket}
    [f,g] := \sum \limits_{i=1}^n \pdiff{f}{p_i}\pdiff{g}{q_i} - 
        \pdiff{f}{q_i}\pdiff{g}{p_i}
    .
\end{equation}
Finally, the Kronecker delta \(\delta_i^j = 1\) if \(i = j\) and \(0\)
otherwise.

%/========== Problem Formulation ==========/%
\section{Problem Formulation}\label{sec:problem-formulation}
We will use the simplified acrobot model in Figure
\ref{fig:simple-acrobot-model}, where we assume the torso and leg rods are of
equal length \(l\) with equal point masses \(m\) at the tips.
A real gymnast cannot swing their legs in full circles, though they
are usually flexible enough to raise them parallel to the floor;
hence, we assume the leg angle \(q_a\) lies in \([-Q_a, Q_a]\) for some
\(Q_a \in [\frac{\pi}{2}, \pi[\). 
We also ignore any frictional forces.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{simple_acrobot_model.pdf}
    \caption{A simple acrobot has massless rods of equal length \(l\) and 
    equal masses \(m\) at the tips.}
    \label{fig:simple-acrobot-model}
\end{figure}

The acrobot has inertia matrix 
\(M\), potential function \(V\) (with respect to
the horizontal bar), and input matrix \(B\) given as follows:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:acrobot-inertia}
    M(q) &= \begin{bmatrix}
        ml^2\left(3+2\cos(q_a)\right) & 
        ml^2\left(1+\cos(q_a)\right) \\
        ml^2\left(1+\cos(q_a)\right) &
        ml^2
    \end{bmatrix} 
    , \\
    \label{eqn:acrobot-potential}
    V(q) &= -mgl\left(2\cos(q_u)+\cos(q_u+q_a)\right)
    , \\
    \label{eqn:acrobot-B}
    B &= [0;1]
    .
\end{align}
For reasons that will become clear in later sections of this article, we will
use Hamiltonian mechanics to derive the dynamics of the acrobot. 
For this we require the conjugate of momenta, \(p = (p_u,p_a) = M(q)\dot{q}\).
The dynamics of the acrobot in \((q,p)\) coordinates are given in
~\eqref{eqn:acrobot-hamiltonian}.
For shorthand, we write \(c_u := \cos(q_u)\), \(c_a := \cos(q_a)\), and 
\(c_{ua} := \cos(q_u + q_a)\); likewise, \(s_u := \sin(q_u)\), 
\(s_a := \sin(q_a)\), and \(s_{ua} := \sin(q_u + q_a)\).
\begin{align}\label{eqn:acrobot-hamiltonian}
    \mathcal{H}(q,p) &= \frac{1}{2}p\tpose \Minv(q) p -
    mgl\left(2 c_u + c_{ua}\right)
    , \\
     &\begin{cases}
        \dot{q} = \Minv(q) p 
        ,\\
        \dot{p}_u = -mgl\left(2s_u + s_{ua}\right) 
        ,\\
        \dot{p}_a =-\frac{1}{2}p\tpose \nabla_{q_a}\Minv(q) p
        - mgl s_{ua} + \tau.
    \end{cases} \nonumber
\end{align}
The control input is a force \(\tau \in \R\) affecting only the dynamics of
\(p_a\), representing a torque acting on the hip joint.

Our goal is to design a smooth function \(f : \Sone \times \R\) such that the
relation \(q_a = f(q_u,p_u)\) is a regular VNHC, where the constrained dynamics
of the acrobot (under this constraint) gain energy on some set \(D\)
in the sense of Definition \ref{defn:energy-gain}.
We will formally define regularity in the next section.
Essentially, if the constraint meets some regularity conditions then it can be
stabilized via feedback.

\begin{defn}\label{defn:energy-gain}
    Let \(\mathcal{Q}\) be an
    \(n\)-dimensional smooth generalized cylinder.
    Let \(f : \mathcal{Q} \rightarrow \mathcal{Q}\times\R^n\) be a smooth vector
    field and let \(D \subset M\) be open.
    The system described by \(\dot{x} = f(x)\) 
    \textit{gains energy on \(D\)} if, 
    for all compact sets \(K \subset D\) and for almost every initial
    condition \(x(0) \in K\), there exists \(T > 0\) such
    that \(x(t) \notin K \, (\forall t > T)\).
    The system \textit{loses energy on \(D\)} if it gains energy in
    negative-time.
\end{defn}

Note that any system satisfying Definition \ref{defn:energy-gain}
can have unstable equilibria on \(D\), but not limit cycles nor closed orbits.

Before embarking on our design problem, let us summarize the relevant theory of
VNHCs.

%/========== VNHC ==========/%
\section{Theory of VNHCs}\label{sec:vnhc}

\subsection{Simply Actuated Hamiltonian Systems} \label{sec:vnhc-sah}
Take a mechanical system modelled with generalized coordinates 
\(q = (q_1, \ldots, q_n)\) on a configuration manifold
\(\mathcal{Q} = \Rt{T_1} \times \cdot \Rt{T_n}\), where
\(T_i = 2\pi\) if \(q_i\) is an angle and \(T_i = \infty\) if \(q_i\) is a
displacement. The corresponding generalized velocities are 
\(\dot{q} = (\dot{q}_1,\ldots,\dot{q}_n) \in \R^n\).

Suppose this system has Lagrangian
\(\mathcal{L}(q,\dot{q}) = 1/2~\dot{q}^T D(q) \dot{q} - P(q)\),
where the potential energy 
\(P : \mathcal{Q} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) 
is smooth, and the inertia matrix 
\(D : \mathcal{Q} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\)
is smooth and positive definite for all \(q \in \mathcal{Q}\).
The \textit{conjugate of momentum} to \(q\) is the vector
\(p := \partial\mathcal{L}/\partial\dot{q} = D(q) \dot{q} \in \R^n\).
As per \cite{landau_mechanics}, 
the \textit{Hamiltonian} of the system in \((q,p)\) coordinates
is
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:hamiltonian}
    \mathcal{H}(q,p) = \frac{1}{2} p\tpose D\inv(q) p + P(q)
    ,
\end{equation}
with dynamics
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:hamiltonian-eom-general}
    \begin{cases}
        \dot{q} = \nabla_p\mathcal{H} 
        , \\
        \dot{p} = -\nabla_q\mathcal{H} + B(q) \tau
        ,
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where \(\tau \in \R^k\) is a vector of generalized input forces and the input
matrix \(B : \mathcal{Q} \rightarrow \R^{n \times k}\) is full rank for all 
\(q \in \mathcal{Q}\).
If \(k < n\), we say the system is \textit{underactuated} with degree of
underactuation \((n-k)\).

It is easy to show using the matrix Kronecker product that
\eqref{eqn:hamiltonian-eom-general} expands to
\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:hamiltonian-full-dynamics}
     \begin{cases}
        \dot{q} = D\inv(q)p 
        , \\
        \dot{p} = -\frac{1}{2} (\Id{n} \otimes p\tpose) \nabla_q D\inv(q) p
        - \nabla_q P(q) + B(q) \tau
        . \\
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
%\begin{align*}
%    \dot{q} &= D\inv(q)p 
%    ,\\
%    \dot{p} &= -\frac{1}{2} (\Id{n} \otimes p\tpose) \nabla_q D\inv(q) p
%        - \nabla_q P(q) + B(q) \tau
%    .
%\end{align*}

Because \(\tau\) is transformed by \(B(q)\), it is not obvious how any
particular input force \(\tau_i\) affects the system.
As a first step in addressing this problem, we make the following assumptions.

\begin{assm}\label{assm:B-const}
    The input matrix \(B(q) \equiv B \in \R^{n\times k}\) is constant,
    full rank, and \(k < n\).
\end{assm}

\begin{assm}\label{assm:B-perp}
    There exists a right semi-orthogonal matrix 
    \(B^\perp \in \R^{(n-k)\times n}\)
    which is a left-annihilator for \(B\). 
\end{assm}

Note that Assumption \ref{assm:B-perp} requires the rows of \(B^\perp\) be unit vectors
that are mutually orthogonal. 
When \(k = (n-1)\), Assumption \ref{assm:B-perp} can be removed because it is
automatically implied by Assumption \ref{assm:B-const}.

The above assumptions allow us to define a
canonical coordinate transformation of ~\eqref{eqn:hamiltonian} 
which decouples the input forces.
To define this transformation we will make use of the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:B-orthogonal}
    Suppose Assumption \ref{assm:B-const} holds. Then
    there exists a nonsingular matrix \(\hat{T} \in \R^{k \times k}\) 
    so that the regular feedback transformation 
    \[
        \tau = \hat{T} \hat{\tau}
    \] 
    has a new input matrix \(\hat{B}\) for \(\hat{\tau}\) which is left
    semi-orthogonal.  
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Since \(B\) is constant and full rank, it has a singular value decomposition 
    \(B = U\tpose \Sigma V\) where 
    \(\Sigma = [\diag{\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_k}; \Zmat{(n-k)\times k}]\),
    \(\sigma_i > 0\), and \(U \in R^{n \times n}\),
    \(V \in \R^{k \times k}\) are unitary matrices \cite{calculating_svd}.
    Defining \(T = \diag{1/\sigma_1,\ldots,1/\sigma_k}\) and assigning the
    regular feedback transformation \(\tau = V T \hat{\tau}\) yields a new input
    matrix \(\hat{B} = B V T\) for \(\hat{\tau}\) such that
    \(\hat{B}\tpose \hat{B} = T\tpose \Sigma\tpose \Sigma T = \Id{k}\).
\end{proof}

In light of Lemma \ref{lemma:B-orthogonal}, there is no loss of generality in
assuming that the input matrix is left semi-orthogonal.
Now, let \(\mathbf{B} := [B^\perp; B\tpose]\).
Since \(B^\perp\) is a left annihilator of \(B\) and both \(B^\perp\) and
\(B\tpose\) are right semi-orthogonal, one can easily show that \(\mathbf{B}\) is
an orthogonal matrix.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:simply-actuated}
    Take the Hamiltonian system ~\eqref{eqn:hamiltonian} and suppose
    Assumptions \ref{assm:B-const} and \ref{assm:B-perp} hold.
    The coordinate transformation
    \(\left(\tilde{q} = \mathbf{B}q, \tilde{p} = \mathbf{B}p\right)\)
    is a canonical transformation and the resulting dynamics are given by 
    \begin{gather}\label{eqn:simple-hamiltonian}
        \mathcal{H}(\tilde{q},\tilde{p}) = 
        \frac{1}{2} \tilde{p}\tpose \Minv(\tilde{q}) \tilde{p} + V(\tilde{q})
        , \\
       \begin{cases}
           \dot{\tilde{q}} = \Minv(\tilde{q})\tilde{p}
           , \\
           \dot{\tilde{p}} = -\frac{1}{2} (\Id{n} \otimes \tilde{p}\tpose)
           \nabla_{\tilde{q}} \Minv(\tilde{q}) \tilde{p} \\
           \phantom{---} - \nabla_{\tilde{q}} V(\tilde{q}) + \simpleB \tau
            ,
        \end{cases} \nonumber
    \end{gather}
    where 
    \(\Minv(\tilde{q}) := 
    \mathbf{B}D^{-1}(\mathbf{B}\tpose \tilde{q})\mathbf{B}\tpose\)
    and
    \(V(\tilde{q}) := P(\mathbf{B}\tpose \tilde{q})\).
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Since \(\mathbf{B}\) is constant, this transformation satisfies
    \(\partial\tilde{q}_i/\partial p_j = \partial\tilde{p}_i/\partial q_j = 0\) for all 
    \(i,j \in \{1,\ldots,n\}\).
    This implies the Poisson brackets \([\tilde{q}_i, \tilde{q}_j]\)
    and \([\tilde{p}_i,\tilde{p}_j]\) are both zero.
    Then, since \(\mathbf{B}\) is orthogonal, 
    \([\tilde{p}_i, \tilde{q}_j] = (\mathbf{B}_i)\tpose (\mathbf{B}\tpose)_j
        = \delta_i^j\).
    By (45.10) in \cite{landau_mechanics}, this is a canonical transformation
    and the new Hamiltonian is
    \(\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{B}\tpose \tilde{q}, \mathbf{B}\tpose \tilde{p})\).
    Finally, since \(\dot{\tilde{p}} = \mathbf{B} \dot{p}\), the input
    matrix for the system in \((\tilde{q},\tilde{p})\) coordinates is
    \(\mathbf{B}B = [\Zmat{(n-k)\times k}; \Id{k}]\), which proves the theorem.
\end{proof}

We call the \((\tilde{q},\tilde{p})\) coordinates
\textit{simply actuated coordinates}.
The first \((n-k)\) configuration variables in \(\tilde{q}\), labelled \(q_u\),
are the \textit{unactuated coordinates}; 
the remaining \(k\) configuration variables, labelled \(q_a\), are the
\textit{actuated coordinates}.
The corresponding \((p_u, p_a)\) in \(\tilde{p}\) are the \textit{unactuated}
and \textit{actuated momenta}, respectively.

\subsection{Virtual Nonholonomic Constraints}\label{sec:vnhc-vnhc}

Griffin and Grizzle \cite{nhvc_dynamic_walking} were the first to define
relative degree two nonholonomic constraints which can be enforced
through state feedback.
Horn et. al later extended their results
\cite{hybrid_zero_dynamics_bipedal_nhvcs} to derive the constrained dynamics for
a certain class of mechanical systems.

These researchers made use of the unactuated conjugate of momentum, but they
developed their results in the Lagrangian framework.
In particular, they focused on Lagrangian systems with degree of underactuation
one.
In this section we reformulate their ideas into the Hamiltonian framework and
extend the definition of a virtual nonholonomic constraint to systems with
higher degree of underactuation.
This reformulation will provide us with better intuition and a more explicit form of the
constrained dynamics.

For the rest of this section we take the system of inquiry to be a
Hamiltonian mechanical system in simply actuated coordinates, as in
\eqref{eqn:simple-hamiltonian}.
For simplicity of notation, we relabel \((\tilde{q},\tilde{p})\) to \((q,p)\).

\begin{defn}\label{defn:vnhc}
    A \textit{virtual nonholonomic constraint} (VNHC) \textit{of order \(k\)} is a
    relation \(h(q,p) = 0\) where \(h : \mathcal{Q}\times\R^n \rightarrow \R^k\) is
    \(C^2\), \(\rank{\left[ dh_q,\, dh_p \right]} = k\) for all 
    \((q,p) \in h\inv(0)\), and there exists a feedback controller \(\tau(q,p)\)
    rendering the \textit{constraint manifold} \(\Gamma\) invariant,
    where
    \begin{equation}
        \Gamma = \left\{(q,p) \mid h(q,p) = 0, dh_q \dot{q} + dh_p \dot{p} = 0\right\}
        .
    \end{equation}
\end{defn}

The constraint manifold is a \(2(n-k)\)-dimensional
closed embedded submanifold of \(\mathcal{Q} \times \R^n\).
A VNHC thereby allows us to study a reduced-order model of the system: it reduces
the original \(2n\) differential equations to \(2(n-k)\) equations.
In particular, if \(k = (n-1)\), the constraint manifold is \textit{always}
2-dimensional and its dynamics can be plotted on a plane. 

We often want to stabilize a constraint within some neighbourhood of \(\Gamma\).
To see when this is possible, let us define the error output \(e = h(q,p)\).
If any component of \(e_i\) has relative degree 1, we may not be able
to stabilize \(\Gamma\) -- we can always guarantee \(e_i \to 0\), but not
necessarily \(\dot{e}_i \to 0\).
It is for this reason that we define the following special type of VNHC.

\begin{defn}
    A VNHC \(h(q,p) = 0\) of order \(k\) is \textit{regular} if the output 
    \(e = h(q,p)\) is of relative degree \(\{2,2.\ldots,2\}\) everywhere on the
    constraint manifold \(\Gamma\).
\end{defn}

The authors of
\cite{nhvc_dynamic_walking,hybrid_zero_dynamics_bipedal_nhvcs}
observed that relations which use only the unactuated conjugate of momentum
often have vector relative degree \(\{2,\ldots,2\}\).
Indeed, we shall now provide a characterization of regularity which shows that
regular constraints cannot use the actuated momentum at all.

To ease notation in the rest of this section, we use the following shorthand:
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{A}(q,p_u) &:= dh_q(q,p_u) \Minv(q) 
        ,\\
    \mathcal{M}(q,p) &:= (\Id{n-k} \otimes p\tpose)\nabla_{q_u}\Minv(q) 
    .
\end{align}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:vnhc-regularity}
    A relation \(h(q,p) = 0\) for system ~\eqref{eqn:simple-hamiltonian}
    is a regular VNHC of order \(k\) if and only if 
    \(dh_{p_a} = \Zmat{k \times k}\) 
    and
    \[
        \rank{\left(\mathcal{A}(q,p_u) - dh_{p_u}\mathcal{M}(q,p)\right)\simpleB} = k
         ,
    \]
    everywhere on the constraint manifold \(\Gamma\).
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Let \(e = h(q,p) \in \R^k\).
    If \(dh_{p_a} \neq \Zmat{k\times k}\) for some \((q,p) \in \Gamma\), 
    then \(\tau\) appears in \(\dot{e}\) and the VNHC is not of relative degree
    \(\{2,\ldots,2\}\). Suppose now that \(dh_{p_a} = \Zmat{k\times k}\).
    Then 
    \(\dot{e} = \mathcal{A}(q,p_u)p - 
     dh_{p_u}\left(1/2~\mathcal{M}(q,p)p + \nabla_{q_u}V(q)\right)\).
    Taking one further derivative provides
    \( \ddot{e} = (\star) - 
        dh_{p_u}\left(1/2~d/dt~\left(\mathcal{M}(q,p)p\right)\right) 
        + \mathcal{A}(q,p_u)[\Zmat{(n-k)\times k};\Id{k}] \tau\),
    where \((\star)\) is a continuous function of \(q\) and \(p\).
    One can further show that
    \(dh_{p_u}\left(1/2~d/dt~\left(\mathcal{M}(q,p)p\right)\right)
        = (\star) + dh_{p_u}\mathcal{M}(q,p)[\Zmat{(n-k)\times k};
        \Id{k}]\tau\).
    Hence,
    \[
       \ddot{e} = (\star) +
       \left(\mathcal{A}(q,p_u) - dh_{p_u}\mathcal{M}(q,p)\right) \simpleB \tau
        ,
    \]
    which we write as \( \ddot{e} = E(q,p) + H(q,p)\tau\) for appropriate \(E\)
    and \(H\).
    From the definition of regularity, the VNHC \(h\) is regular 
    when \(e\) is of relative degree \(\{2,\ldots,2\}\), which is true 
    if and only if the matrix premultiplying \(\tau\) is nonsingular, and hence
    that \(H\) is invertible. This proves the theorem.
\end{proof}

Under additional mild conditions (see \cite{vhcs_for_el_systems}), a regular VNHC of
order \(k\) can be stabilized by the output-linearizing phase-feedback
controller
\begin{equation}
    \tau(q,p) = -H\inv(q,p)\left(E(q,p) + k_p e + k_d \dot{e}\right)
    ,
\end{equation}
where \(k_p, k_d > 0\) are control parameters which can be tuned on the
resulting error dynamices \(\ddot{e} = -k_p e - k_d \dot{e}\).

In Section \ref{sec:acrobot} we will enforce a regular constraint on the
acrobot of the form \(h(q,p) = q_a - f(q_u,p_u)\), where the actuators track a
function of the unactuated variables.
Intuitively then, the constrained dynamics should be parameterized by \((q_u, p_u)\).
Unfortunately, \(\dot{q}_u\) depends on \(p_a\), and for general systems one
cannot solve explicitly for \(p_a\) in terms of \((q_u,p_u)\) because
the \(\dot{p}\) dynamics contains the coupling term 
\((\Id{n} \otimes p\tpose)\nabla_{q}M(q)p\). 

We now introduce an assumption which allows us to solve for \(p_a\) as a
function of \((q_u,p_u)\), which in turn allows us to find the constrained
dynamics.

\begin{assm}\label{assm:inertially-actuated}
The inertia matrix does not depend on the unactuated coordinates, so that 
\(\nabla_{q_u}M(q) = \Zmat{n(n-k) \times n}\).
\end{assm}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:zero-dynamics}
    Let \(\mathcal{H}\) be a mechanical system in simply actuated
    coordinates satisfying Assumption \ref{assm:inertially-actuated}. 
    Let \(h(q,p_u) = 0\) be a regular VNHC of order \(k\) with constraint
    manifold \(\Gamma\). Suppose that on \(\Gamma\) one can solve for
    \(q_a\) as a function \(q_a = f(q_u,p_u)\).
    Then the constrained dynamics are given by
    \begin{equation}\label{eqn:qpu-dynamics}
        \left.\begin{aligned}
                \dot{q}_u &= 
                \left[\Id{(n-k)} ~ \Zmat{(n-k) \times k}\right]
                \Minv(q)p \\
            \dot{p}_u &= -\nabla_{q_u}V(q) \\
            \end{aligned}{}\right|_{\begin{array}{c}
                q_a = f(q_u,p_u) \\ 
                p_a = g(q_u,p_u) \\
            \end{array}}
            ,
    \end{equation}
    where
    \begin{align}\label{eqn:g-qpu}
        &g(q_u,p_u) := 
        \left(\mathcal{A}(q,p_u)[\Zmat{(n-k)\times k};\Id{k}] \right)\inv 
        (dh_{p_u} \nabla_{q_u}V(q) \nonumber
        \\
        &- \mathcal{A}(q,p_u)[\Id{(n-k)};\Zmat{k \times(n-k)}]p_u
        \left.)\right|_{q_a = f(q_u,p_u)}
        .
    \end{align}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Setting \(e = h(q,p_u)\) and using Assumption
    \ref{assm:inertially-actuated}, we find that
    \(\dot{e} = \mathcal{A}(q,p_u)p - dh_{p_u}\nabla_{q_u}V(q)\).
    Notice that
    \(\mathcal{A}(q,p_u)p = \mathcal{A}(q,p_u)[\Zmat{(n-k)\times k}; \Id{k}]p_a
    + \mathcal{A}(q,p_u)[\Id{n-k};\Zmat{k \times (n-k)}] p_u\).
    Since \(h(q,p_u)\) is regular, \(\mathcal{A}(q,p_u)\) is invertible.
    Taking \(e = \dot{e} = 0\), solving for \(p_a\), and setting 
    \(q_a = f(q_u,p_u)\) completes the proof.
\end{proof}

We conclude this section by formalizing the notion of energy
injection/dissipation for VNHCs.

\begin{defn}\label{defn:energy-injection}
    A regular VNHC \(h(q, p) = 0\) with constraint manifold \(\Gamma\)
    \textit{injects (dissipates) energy on \(D \subset \Gamma\)} if the
    constrained dynamics gain (lose) energy everywhere on \(D\) according to
    Definition \ref{defn:energy-gain}, except possibly on a set of measure
    zero.
\end{defn}

\textbf{Comparison with existing literature}: Horn et.al. provide the constrained
dynamics for VNHCs in \cite{nhvc_incline_walking}.
Their assumption \textbf{H2} is what we call regularity, and our requirement
that one can solve for \(q_a = f(q_u,p_u)\) on \(\Gamma\) implies their
assumption \textbf{H3} holds true.
The only real distinction between this section and their work
is that our constrained dynamics are explicit functions of the Hamiltonian phase
coordinates \((q_u,p_u)\).
In fact, our constrained dynamics \eqref{eqn:qpu-dynamics} coincide with their
system (17) when one chooses the special case \(\theta_1 = q_u\) and 
\(\theta_2 = p_u\).
This explicit representation will be beneficial when we apply the theory of
VNHCs to the acrobot.

%/========== Acrobot ==========/%
\section{The Acrobot VNHC}\label{sec:acrobot}

Our goal in this article is to design a VNHC which injects energy into the
acrobot through giant-like motion.
Recall that the acrobot in Figure \ref{fig:simple-acrobot-model} has dynamics given by
~\eqref{eqn:acrobot-hamiltonian}, which are
repeated here:
\begin{align*}
    \mathcal{H}(q,p) &= \frac{1}{2}p\tpose \Minv(q) p -
    mgl\left(2 c_u + c_{ua}\right)
    , \\
     &\begin{cases}
        \dot{q} = \Minv(q) p 
        ,\\
        \dot{p}_u = -mgl\left(2s_u + s_{ua}\right) 
        ,\\
        \dot{p}_a =-\frac{1}{2}p\tpose \nabla_{q_a}\Minv(q) p
        - mgl s_{ua} + \tau.
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}

Since the control input \(\tau\) only affects the actuated momentum,
\((q,p)\) are simply actuated coordinates in the phase space
\(\mathcal{Q} \times \mathcal{P}\) where
\(\mathcal{Q} = \Sone \times \Sone\), and
\(\mathcal{P} = \R \times \R\).
We can therefore apply the theory from Section \ref{sec:vnhc} to design
a VNHC of the form \(q_a = f(q_u,p_u)\). 
Since we need the VNHC to be regular, the following proposition will be
useful.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:acrobot-fpu-regular}
    A relation \(h(q,p) = q_a - f(p_u) = 0\) 
    with \(f \in C^2\left(\R; \Sone\right)\) is a regular
    VNHC of order 1 for the acrobot.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    The regularity matrix for the acrobot evaluates to
    \(((1+c_a)\partial_{q_u}f(q_u,p_u) + (3+2c_a))/(ml^2(2-c_a^2))\).
    Since \(\partial_{q_u} f = 0\), this matrix is strictly positive for all values
    of \(q_a\), and hence is full rank everywhere on the constraint manifold.
\end{proof}

To design our VNHC, we begin by examining a person on a
seated swing.
The person extends their legs when the swing moves forwards, and retracts their
legs when the swing moves backwards.
As the swing gains speed, the person leans their body while
extending their legs higher, thereby shortening the distance
from their center of mass to the pivot and adding more energy to the swing
\cite{how_to_pump_a_swing}.

Now imagine the person's torso is affixed to the swing's rope so they are
always upright. 
Imagine further that the swing has no seat at all, allowing the person to extend
their legs beneath them. 
This position is identical to that of a gymnast on a bar.

The acrobot's legs are rigid rods which cannot retract, so we emulate the person
on a swing by pivoting the legs toward the direction of motion. 
Since a person lifts their legs higher at higher speeds, the acrobot's legs should
pivot to an angle proportional to the swing's speed.
Because the direction of motion is entirely determined by \(p_u\), 
one VNHC which emulates this process is \(q_a = \bar{q}_a\arctan( I p_u)\),
displayed in Figure \ref{fig:qa-arctan}.
Here, \(\bar{q}_a \in \, ]0,2 Q_a/\pi]\) is constant and \(I \in \R\) is a fixed
control parameter.

This constraint does not perfectly recreate giant motion, during which
the gymnast's legs are almost completely extended \cite{usagym_giant}.
It instead pivots the legs partially during rotations.
However, the behaviour looks similar enough that this constraint will
still inject energy into the acrobot.
Our final VNHC is
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:acrobot-constraint}
    h(q,p) = q_a - \bar{q}_a \arctan(I p_u)
    .
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{qa_arctan.pdf}
    \caption{The acrobot constraint \(q_a = \bar{q}_a \arctan(I p_u)\).}
    \label{fig:qa-arctan}
\end{figure}

Recall that \((q_u, p_u)\) denote the angle and momentum of the acrobot's torso.
By Theorem \ref{thm:zero-dynamics}, the constrained acrobot is parameterized
fully by \((q_u,p_u) \in \SxR\).
It is easy to show that the constrained dynamics are just the torso dynamics
obtained when one swings the legs according to \eqref{eqn:acrobot-constraint}.
That is, the constrained dynamics are
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:acrobot-constrained-dynamics}
    \begin{cases}
    \dot{q}_u &= \frac{(1+I^2 p_u^2)p_u + m^2gl^3\bar{q}_a I(2s_u + s_{ua})(1+c_a) }
            {ml^2(1+I^2 p_u^2)(3+2c_a)}
    ,    \\
    \dot{p}_u &= - m g l (2s_u + s_{ua})
    ,
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
subject to \(q_a = \bar{q}_a \arctan(I p_u)\).

Suppose for a moment that \(I = 0\), i.e.~that the legs stay fully extended.
The acrobot becomes a nominal pendulum with two masses, whose total mechanical
energy is
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:acrobot-energy}
    E(q_u,p_u) := \frac{p_u^2}{10ml^2} + 3mgl(1 - \cos(q_u))
    .
\end{equation}
The upright equilibrium of this pendulum is located at \((q_u,p_u) = (\pi,0)\).
Imagine the pendulum hits the bottom of the swing arc with momentum 
\(p_u \neq 0\). 
To reach the upright equilibrium, this momentum must be
\(p_u = \pm\sqrt{60m^2gl^3}\) because \(E(\pi,0) = E(0,\pm\sqrt{60m^2gl^3})\).
If the momentum is smaller in magnitude, the acrobot will oscillate; 
if it is larger, the pendulum will rotate around the bar.

When the pendulum is oscillating, its phase \((q_u,p_u)\) lies in the set
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:oscillation-domain}
    \mathcal{O}_1 := \left\{(q_u,p_u) \in \SxR 
    \mid E(q_u,p_u) < E(\pi,0) \right\}
    ,
\end{equation}
which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:acrobot-oscillation-domain}.
If for some \(I \neq 0\) our VNHC injects energy into the acrobot on 
\(\mathcal{O}_1\), and the constrained dynamics escape
\(\mathcal{O}_1\) in finite time, then the acrobot is guaranteed to perform
giant-like motion and begin rotating around the bar.

When the pendulum is rotating with bounded momentum
\(\abs{p_u} < \bar{\rho}\) (for some chosen \(\bar{\rho}\)),
the phase must lie inside the rotation domain
\begin{multline}\label{eqn:rotation-domain}
    \mathcal{R}(\rho) := \left\{
        (q_u,p_u) \in \SxR \mid\right.
        \\
        \left.E(\pi,0) < E(q_u,p_u) < E(0,\rho)
    \right\}
    .
\end{multline}
Connecting the regions \eqref{eqn:oscillation-domain} and
\eqref{eqn:rotation-domain} yields the set
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:o-rhobar}
    \mathcal{O}_2(\bar{\rho}) := \left\{(q_u,p_u) \in \SxR
        \mid E(q_u,p_u) < E(0,\bar{\rho}) \right\}
    ,
\end{equation}
shown in Figure \ref{fig:acrobot-o2}.
If the VNHC injects energy on \(\mathcal{O}_2(\bar{\rho})\) for some 
\(I \neq 0\), then the acrobot must necessarily swing up, begin rotating, 
and eventually rotate with a momentum of at least \(\bar{\rho}\).

        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{acrobot_oscillation_domain.pdf}

            will pass through the level set \(E(\pi,0)\) of the nominal pendulum.}

            set are guaranteed to reach the level set \(E(0,\bar{\rho})\) of the

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{The sets on which the acrobot gains energy, according to Theorem
        \ref{thm:acrobot-energy-stabilization}.}
\end{figure}

Unfortunately, our VNHC does not always inject energy on \(\mathcal{O}_1\) and
\(\mathcal{O}_2(\bar{\rho})\).
If \(I\) is too large, the leg controller saturates and the body oscillates
without gaining energy.
Choosing \(I\) small enough guarantees the legs will synchronize
properly with the body, and the acrobot will begin rotating around the bar.
The following theorem provides conditions under which such an \(I\) exists.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:acrobot-energy-stabilization}
    Consider the acrobot with Hamiltonian dynamics as in ~\eqref{eqn:acrobot-hamiltonian}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For any \(m\), \(g\), \(l\), \(\bar{q}_a\), there exists
        \(I^\star > 0\) such that, for all \(I \in \, ]0,I^\star]\), the VNHC
        ~\eqref{eqn:acrobot-constraint} injects energy into the acrobot on
        \(\mathcal{O}_1\).
        Moreover, almost every orbit will escape the closure of
        \(\mathcal{O}_1\) in finite time.
        If instead \(I \in [-I^\star,0[\), the VNHC dissipates energy.
    \item Let \(C = m^2gl^3\bar{q}_a\) and 
        define \(b : \SxR_{> 0} \rightarrow \R\) by
    \[
        b(\beta,\rho_0) := 
        \frac{5C \left(
        \frac{C}{\bar{q}_a}\left(18s_\beta^2 + 30c_\beta(1 - c_\beta)\right)
            - c_\beta\rho_0^2
        \right)}{
        |\rho_0|\sqrt{\rho_0^2 - 30m^2gl^3(1 - c_\beta)}
        }
        .
    \]
        Define 
        \(S(\rho_0) := \int \limits_{0}^{2\pi} b(\sigma,\rho_0)d\sigma\).
        Fix \(\bar{\rho} > \sqrt{60m^2gl^3}\) and
        suppose there exists \(\epsilon > 0\) so that 
        \(S(\rho_0) \geq \epsilon\) for all 
        \(\rho_0 \in \, \left]\sqrt{60m^2gl^3}, \bar{\rho}\right]\).
        Then there exists \(I^{\star\star} \in \, ]0, I^\star]\) such that, for all 
        \(I \in \, ]0,I^{\star\star}]\), the VNHC
        ~\eqref{eqn:acrobot-constraint} injects energy into the acrobot on
        \(\mathcal{O}_2(\bar{\rho})\).
        If instead \(I \in [-I^{\star\star},0[\), the VNHC dissipates energy.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    See Section \ref{sec:proof}.
\end{proof}

Notice that \(\mathcal{O}_1 \subset \mathcal{O}_2(\bar{\rho})\), yet
Theorem \ref{thm:acrobot-energy-stabilization} considers these sets separately.
This separation is advantageous because the first result holds for any
\(m\), \(g\), \(l\), and \(\bar{q}_a\). 
In other words, the first result of Theorem
\ref{thm:acrobot-energy-stabilization} states that all acrobots constrained by
~\eqref{eqn:acrobot-constraint} will gain enough energy to begin rotating around
the bar.
%In the worst case, the acrobot will at least perform a swing-up routine to reach
%the unstable equilibrium at \((q_u,p_u) = (\pi,0)\).

For the acrobot to achieve giants with energy
\(E(0,\bar{\rho})\), it must satisfy the assumption on the integral
of \(b(\beta,\rho_0)\). 
The value of this integral depends on the acrobot's physical parameters.
If the assumption holds, there is some control value \(I\)
(which depends on \(\bar{\rho}\)) for which the acrobot will 
achieve rotations with a momentum of at least \(\bar{\rho}\).

The results of Theorem \ref{thm:acrobot-energy-stabilization} lead naturally to
the idea of energy regulation: one could employ a supervisor which switches
between injection and dissipation constraints to stabilize a desired energy
level \(\bar{E}\).
For instance, the supervisor could inject energy when \(E(q_u,p_u) < \bar{E}\) 
and dissipate energy when \(E(q_u,p_u) > \bar{E}\), with some hysteresis to
avoid infinite switching.

%/========== Experiments ==========/%
\section{Simulation Results}\label{sec:simulations}
In Section \ref{sec:experiments} we will test our VNHC on the physical acrobot
built by Xingbo Wang \cite{xingbo_thesis}.

Note that this acrobt does not correspond to the simple acrobot in Figure
\ref{fig:simple-acrobot-model}, but rather to the more general acrobot model in
Figure \ref{fig:acrobot-model}.
If we define 
\begin{align*}
    m_{11}(q) := &m_a l_u^2 + 2m_al_ul_{c_a}\cos(q_a) + m_al_{c_a}^2 +
    m_ul_{c_u}^2 \\
                 &+ J_u + J_a
                 , \\
    m_{12}(q) := &m_al_{c_a}^2 + m_al_ul_{c_a}\cos(q_a) + J_a
    , \\
    m_{22}(q) := &m_al_{c_a}^2 + J_a,
\end{align*}
then the inertia matrix and potential for the physical acrobot are
\begin{align*}
    M(q) &= \begin{bmatrix}
        m_{11}(q) & m_{12}(q) \\
        m_{12}(q) & m_{22}(q)
    \end{bmatrix}
    , \\
    V(q) &= g\big(m_al_{c_a}(1-c_{ua})
    + (m_al_u + m_ul_{c_u})(1-c_u)\big).
\end{align*}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{acrobot_model.pdf}
    \caption{The general acrobot model, represented by two weighted rods
    differing in both length and mass.}%
    \label{fig:acrobot-model}
\end{figure}

Evaluating the true mechanical energy of this acrobot at the VNHC
\(q_a = 0\) yields the energy of the nominal pendulum,
\[
    E(q_u,p_u) \approx 396.5501 p_u^2 + 0.5997(1 - \cos(q_u))
    .
\]

We will simulate our VNHC using the parameters of
this physical robot, which can be found in Table \ref{tab:acrobot-parameters}.
If our VNHC injects energy into this acrobot, then we can infer that
VNHCs are robust to model mismatch.

\subsection{Energy Injection}

According to Theorem \ref{thm:acrobot-energy-stabilization}, the control
parameter \(I\) must be small if one wants the VNHC to inject energy.
While we could make \(I\) arbitrarily small in simulations, we will eventually
implement this VNHC on a physical system where \(I\) must be large enough to
overcome friction in leg motor.
Setting \(\bar{q}_a = 1\), we experimentally determined that \(I = 10\) is a
viable control value for energy injection.

We simulated the acrobot with initial condition 
\((q_u,p_u) = \left(\pi/32,0 \right)\) for \(30\) seconds and plotted the
resulting orbit in Figure \ref{fig:acrobot-in-orbit}.

The level set \(E_\pi\) with energy \(E(\pi,0)\) is outlined in black.
Despite the change in acrobot model, this level set remains the boundary
between oscillations and rotations for the nominal pendulum.
The points where the orbit exits \(E_\pi\) are marked with black stars,
with the final departure marked by a red star.
Interestingly, our choice of \(I\) is large enough that we observe significant
differences between the nominal pendulum and the constrained dynamics:
\(E_\pi\) intersects the \(p_u\)-axis at \(\abs{p_u} \approx 0.18\), yet the
constrained acrobot begins rotating once it hits the
\(p_u\)-axis at \(\abs{p_u} \approx 0.16\). 
This indicates that higher values of \(I\) enable the acrobot to gain energy
faster and begin rotating sooner, so long as the actuator does not saturate.

    \caption{A simulation of the acrobot gaining energy.}
    \label{fig:acrobot-in-orbit}
\end{figure}

To verify numerically that the acrobot would consistently achieve rotations, we
ran a Monte-Carlo simulation \cite{montecarlo} where we initialized the acrobot
randomly inside the sublevel set
\[
    \left\{(q_u,p_u) \in \SxR \mid
    E(q_u,p_u) \leq E\left(\frac{\pi}{32},0\right)\right\}
    ,
\] 
and measured how long it took to begin rotating.
The results in Figure \ref{fig:acrobot-mc} show that
the acrobot always rotated within 20--40 seconds.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Energy Dissipation}

According to Theorem \ref{thm:acrobot-energy-stabilization}, a negative value
of \(I\) will dissipate energy from the acrobot.
To test this, we initialized our acrobot with a rotation at the phase
\((q_u,p_u) = (0,0.18)\),  set \(I = -10\), and simulated the constrained
dynamics for \(30\) seconds.
The resulting orbit is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:acrobot-diss-orbit}. 
As expected, the acrobot slows down over time.
We again highlight the locations where the orbit crossed the set \(E_\pi\) in
black, with the final crossing in red. 
After this crossing, the acrobot ceased rotating and its oscillations decayed to
zero.

    \caption{A simulation of the acrobot dissipating energy.}
    \label{fig:acrobot-diss-orbit}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Oscillation Regulation}

Once can use a simple supervisor to stabilize oscillations by appropriately
toggling between injection and dissipation VNHCs.
Specifically, one chooses a desired oscillation angle 
\(q_\text{des} \in \, ]0,\pi[\) and, to avoid infinite switching, a
hysteresis value \(\delta \in [0,1]\) 
Each time the orbit crosses the \(q_u\)-axis (i.e. \(p_u = 0\)) or 
when \(|q_u| = \pi\), the supervisor changes which VNHC is enforced as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If \(|q_u| < (1-\delta)q_\text{des}\), enable the injection VNHC.
    \item If \(|q_u| > (1+\delta)q_\text{des}\), enable the dissipation VNHC.
    \item If \((1-\delta)q_\text{des} \leq |q_u| \leq (1+\delta)q_\text{des}\),
        keep the leg extended at \(q_a = 0\). This can be done continously since
        \(q_a = 0\) when \(p_u = 0\).
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:acrobot-osc-reg} shows the supervisor stabilizing an
oscillation with body angle \(q_\text{des} = \pi/2\) and a 
\(5\%\) hysteresis, meaning \(\delta = 0.05\).
The supervisor reevaluated its choice of VNHC at each black star;  
the red circle corresponds to the part of the orbit where the supervisor kept
the leg extended, because the oscillation was within tolerance of
\(q_\text{des}\).

In Figure \ref{fig:acrobot-osc-reg-in} the acrobot was initialized at 
\((q_u,p_u) = (\pi/32,0)\); here the supervisor injected energy for most of the
orbit.
In Figure \ref{fig:acrobot-osc-reg-diss} the acrobot was initialized at the rotation
\((q_u,p_u) = (0,0.19)\); here the supervisor dissipated energy. 
In both cases, the supervisor stabilized the desired oscillation .

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Using a supervisor to stabilize the oscillation with peak angle
    \(q_\text{des} = \pi/2\).}
    \label{fig:acrobot-osc-reg}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Rotation Regulation}
Along with stabilizing oscillations, one can use a supervisor to stabilize
rotations.
In this case, one chooses a desired rotation rate \(p_\text{des} > 0\) and a
hystersis value \(\delta \in [0,1]\).
Each time the orbit crosses the \(p_u\)-axis (i.e. when \(q_u = 0\)), the
supervisor changes which VNHC is enforced as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If \(|p_u| < (1-\delta)p_\text{des}\), enable the injection VNHC.
    \item If \(|p_u| > (1+\delta)p_\text{des}\), enable the dissipation VNHC.
    \item If \((1-\delta)p_\text{des} \leq |p_u| \leq (1+\delta)p_\text{des}\),
        extend the leg fully by setting \(q_a = 0\).
        For these simulations, we assume this can be done instantaneously.
\end{itemize}

Rotation regulation is demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:acrobot-rot-reg}, where
the supervisor stabilizes \(p_\text{des} = 0.19\) with a \(2\%\) hysteresis 
\(\delta = 0.02\).
The supervisor changed its choice of VNHC at each black star until it finally extended
the leg (shown in red).

In Figure \ref{fig:acrobot-rot-reg-in} the acrobot was initialized at the
oscillation \((q_u,p_u) = (\pi/2,0)\); here the supervisor injected energy until
the orbit hit the \(p_u\)-axis near \(p_\text{des}\).
In Figure \ref{fig:acrobot-rot-reg-diss} the acrobot was initialized at the
faster rotation \((q_u,p_u) = (0, 0.23)\); the supervisor dissipated energy.
In both cases, the desired rotation was stabilized correctly.

\subsection{Summary of Results}
The simulation results in this section demonstrate the energy regulation
capabilities of our VNHC.  
We were able to stabilize both oscillations and rotations by implementing a
control supervisor which toggled between injection, dissipation, and
leg-extension VNHCs.
In particular, these simulations indicate that our VNHC
works even for acrobots whose limbs have differing masses and lengths.

\section{Physical Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}

\subsection{Hardware Description}
In this section we will demonstrate that our VNHC is robust to friction, sensor
noise, and other real-world considerations by testing it on the physical
acrobot built by Xingbo Wang \cite{xingbo_thesis} 
(Figure \ref{fig:xingbo-acrobot}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{xingbo_acrobot.jpg}
    \caption{The acrobot built by Wang \cite{xingbo_thesis}.}
    \label{fig:xingbo-acrobot}
\end{figure}

This acrobot is comprised of two 3D-printed links: a torso and a leg.
The torso link houses an Arduino Nano microcontroller unit (MCU) which controls
a Dynamixel RX24F servo motor between the torso and the leg.
The MCU and the motor are powered by a 12V battery held in a compartment
in the leg.

The torso is rigidly attached to a metal bar, which is held up by two wooden
posts.
On the exterior of one post is a control box with a power switch and a second
Arduino Nano 328.
The purpose of this control box is to read measurements from a rotary
encoder connected to the metal bar, and to transmit these measurements to the
MCU.
The two Arduinos communicate through wires attached to a slip ring on the metal
bar, and the signals are transmitted via I2C.
The control box also provides a USB interface which allows the user to read the
data from the acrobot in real time.

VNHC implementation requires full knowledge of the acrobot's phase. 
The rotary encoder directly measures \(q_u\), and the Dynamixel servo
motor provides measurements of \(q_a\).
However, there are no sensors measuring the velocity \(\dot{q}\), which means we cannot
directly evaluate \(p_u\) and \(p_a\).
To resolve this issue, the MCU estimates \(\dot{q}\) using sequential measurements of \(q\)
and a washout filter.
We then compute \(p = M(q)\dot{q}\) for use in the VNHC controller.

Communication between the Arduinos restricts the sampling rate of \(p\) to
500Hz.
This low sampling rate results in a noisy momentum signal, which suffers
from noticeable phase lag.
This also rate-limits the control signal to \(500\)Hz, which impacts any control
implementation.

Finally, The Dynamixel servo motor does not have a torque control mode; instead,
we can assign the servo setpoint at iteration \(k \in \mathbb{Z}_{> 0}\)
via \(q_a^{k} = \arctan(10 p_u^{k-1})\).
Unfortunately, this negatively affects the stabilization to the constraint
manifold because we are introducing timing errors from the servo's built-in PID
controller.

The system was given the name SUGAR: Simple Underactuated Gymnastics and
Acrobatics Robot.
Its dynamic parameters are outlined in Table \ref{tab:acrobot-parameters}.

\subsection{Experimental Results}

In Section \ref{sec:simulations} we showed that VNHCs can be used for energy
injection, dissipation, and regulation. 
We will now demonstrate that VNHC-based giant motion is robust to external
disturbances by implementing our VNHC on the SUGAR system.
We performed the following tests.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Baseline Test:} 
    we initialized the acrobot at 
    \((q_u,p_u) \approx \left(\pi/8,0\right)\). 
    The resulting orbit in Figure \ref{fig:acrobot-unperturbed-orbit} shows
    the acrobot clearly gaining energy over time.
    Its motion looks similar to that of the energy injection simulation (Figure
    \ref{fig:acrobot-in-orbit}), though the acrobot appears to stop gaining
    energy once it reaches a rotation with energy \(E(0,0.195)\).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{acrobot_unperturbed_orbit.png}
    \caption{The physical acrobot's orbit during the baseline energy injection test.}
    \label{fig:acrobot-unperturbed-orbit}
\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Stop Test:}
    we initialized the acrobot at 
    \((q_u,p_u) \approx \left(\pi,0\right)\), let it run for 15
    seconds, then stopped it at the bottom of its arc.
    The resulting orbit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:acrobot-stopped-orbit}.
    The blue rotation curve corresponds to the orbit before the disturbance,
    while the red spiral confirms that the acrobot begins oscillating after it
    is stopped.  
    Despite the disturbance, it gains energy and eventually starts rotating
    again.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{acrobot_stopped_orbit.png}
    \caption{The physical acrobot's orbit before (blue) and after (red) stopping.}
    \label{fig:acrobot-stopped-orbit}
\end{figure}


\item \textbf{Push Test:}
    to see how the acrobot responds when pushed, we allowed
    the acrobot to rotate undisturbed for 15 seconds and then pushed it in its
    direction of motion.
    The orbit in Figure \ref{fig:acrobot-fpush-orbit} shows that the acrobot,
    when pushed, rotates with energy \(E(0,-0.22)\), but then slows down until
    it reaches a rotation with energy \(E(0,-0.195)\).
    We repeated this test by pushing the acrobot against its direction of motion.
    The orbit in Figure \ref{fig:acrobot-rpush-orbit} demonstrates that the acrobot
    readily changes direction, and quickly achieves its maximum speed
    with energy \(E(0,0.195)\).
\end{enumerate}

In simulation, the acrobot was able to gain energy even when initialized
with energy \(E(q_u,p_u) > E(0,0.195)\). 
The baseline and push tests suggest that our VNHC injects energy into the SUGAR
system only on \(\mathcal{O}_2(0.195)\).
This difference between simulation and implementation is likely due to
friction.

        \label{fig:acrobot-rpush-orbit}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{The acrobot orbit before (blue) and after (red) pushing.}
\end{figure}

We had hoped to show experimental results for dissipation and
oscillation/rotation regulation, but unfortunately our Dynamixel RX24F servo
motor broke before we could perform these experiments.
These motors are no longer in production at the time of writing, so the SUGAR
system has been retired for the time being.

\subsection{Summary of Results} 
We performed three tests on the SUGAR system: a baseline energy injection test,
a stop test, and a push test.
These experiments demonstrate that VNHC-based energy injection is robust to
significant model mismatch, friction, sensor noise, discretized control
implementation, rate-limited measurement and control signals, and dramatic
external disturbances.
