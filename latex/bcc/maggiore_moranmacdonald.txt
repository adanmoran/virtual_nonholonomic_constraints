When a gymnast hangs on a bar, they do not attempt to track a
trajectory over time to perform their swing-up routine (a so-called
``giant"); likewise, a child on a standing swing does not swing higher
by standing or squatting at specific time instants.  Rather, these
natural human motions involve moving one's legs based on the current
direction and speed of motion.  In doing so, the gymnast will gain
enough energy to start rotating on the bar, and the child will reach
greater heights on their swing.  This style of realistic,
energy-increasing motion can be achieved when controlling mechanical
systems by using the method of virtual nonholonomic constraints.

A virtual nonholonomic constraint (VNHC) is a smooth relation between
the configuration variables and conjugate of momenta of an
n-degree-of-freedom mechanical system with n-1 control inputs.
Enforcing these constraints via feedback control provides
time-independent controllers which, under certain circumstances, may
inject or remove energy from the system.

This talk will give sufficient conditions under which a VNHC can be
enforced by feedback control.  Then, using the motivations of the
child on the standing swing and the gymnast on a bar, we apply the
theory to develop energy-injecting VNHCs for two classical systems:
the variable-length pendulum and the two-link acrobot.

For the variable-length pendulum we design and enforce a VNHC modelled after
the time-optimal swingup motion, without tracking a signal over time. We
then prove that this VNHC will cause the pendulum to gain enough energy to
start rotating completely around the swinging axis.

For the acrobot, we design several VNHCs (modelled from the leg
motions of human gymnasts) which achieve a human-like ``giant" motion.
We then apply one of these VNHCs to a real acrobot and, through
experiments, demonstrate the energy-injection properties of the VNHC
as the robot kicks its legs until it begins doing backflips on the
bar.
