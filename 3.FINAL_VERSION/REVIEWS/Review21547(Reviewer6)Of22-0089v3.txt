The revised version of the paper has significantly improved and the
authors have successfully addressed the raised concerns and provided
detailed responses. 
They have expanded upon the background and motivation behind the
considered approach with the objective of designing virtual
nonholonomic constraints for an acrobot model which emulates gymnastics
giant motion. Additionally, the authors have included a more
comprehensive discussion and comparison with other existing methods
concerning orbital stabilization.  Therefore, based on my overall
evaluation, I recommend the paper for publication in its present form.
